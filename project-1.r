# Step 1: Generate an exponential distribution for 40 exponentials with a rate of 'lambda' = 0.2 (we assumed lambda == 0.2).

# Ensure that the random numbers are always the same by setting the seed

numberOfSimulations <- 1000

#### Analysis 2: How variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

# Calculate Theoretical Variance
theoreticalVariance <- ((1/lambda)^2) / numberOfExponentials
theoreticalVariance

# Calculate Sample Variance
sampleVariance <- var(simulationSetDF$mean)
sampleVariance

# We observe that the sample variance and theoretical variances are very close.

# Analysis 3: Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
# Referring to the plotted histgram we observe that both sample and theoretical distributions are approximately normal
